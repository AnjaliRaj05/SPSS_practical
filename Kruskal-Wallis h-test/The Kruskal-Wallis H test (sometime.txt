The Kruskal-Wallis H test (sometimes also called the "one-way ANOVA on ranks") is a rank-based nonparametric test that can be used to determine if there are statistically significant differences between two or more groups of an independent variable on a continuous or ordinal dependent variable. It is considered the nonparametric alternative to the one-way ANOVA, and an extension of the Mann-Whitney U test to allow the comparison of more than two independent groups.

For example, you could use a Kruskal-Wallis H test to understand whether exam performance, measured on a continuous scale from 0-100, differed based on test anxiety levels (i.e., your dependent variable would be "exam performance" and your independent variable would be "test anxiety level",
